 * Add a class to the system to represent students taking the
 * course for pass/fail credit. Assume that such students need
 * not do the homework, but might do so. If they do, the homework
 * should participate in determining whether they passed or failed,
 * according to the normal formula. If they did no homework, then
 * the grade is the average of their midterm and final grades. A
 * passing grade is 60 or higher.
 *
 * Make sure it inherits from the Core class!
