/*
 *	3-5.cpp
 *
 *	Write a program that will keep track of grades for several
 *	students at once.
 *	
 *	The program could keep two vectors in sync: The first should
 *	hold the student's names, and the second the final grades that
 *	can be computed as input is read.
 *	
 *	For now, you should assume a fixed number of homework grades.
 *	We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to handle a variable number of grades
 *	intermixed with student names.
